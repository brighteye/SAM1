# Readme: SAM1

Based on https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe-vite-starter-kit

This is my first attempt developing an AI product.

I'm about to do a bunch of stupid shit since I'm a human.

But, you have to start somewhere I guess, if you're going to learn.

So, here I am, in all my embarrassing glory ;P 
- Designing the app in Subframe (based on Figma mocks)
- Importing the Subframe code into Replit to build a React app with the help of AI
- Backing it up here 'cause a very wise person advised me to

Eventually, SAM will be able to tell your fortune.
Predict your future.
Guide your outlook on each day, month, year or any timeframe
Support your dreams
Keep you on track
Connect you with what you really want in life
