#SAM1: A toe in the water

Based on https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe-vite-starter-kit

This is my first attempt developing an AI product.

I'm about to do a bunch of stupid shit since I'm a human.

But, you have to start somewhere I guess, if you're going to learn.

So, here I am, in all my embarrassing glory ;P 
- Developing the frontend in Subframe (based on Figma mocks)
- Importing the Subframe code into Replit to build a React app with the help of AI
- Backing it up in a git repo 'cause a very wise person advised me to

Eventually, SAM will be able to: 
- Tell your fortune
- Predict your future
- Guide your outlook on each day, month, year or any timeframe
- Support your dreams
- Keep you on track
- Connect you with what you really want in life
